Whether it's playing games like foosball or having conversations over a shared meal, I find the most enjoyment in these experiences. I also have a passion for building physical products, whether it's a Frankenstein-inspired electric scooter or a web app designed to bring friends closer. I truly love the process of building and creating. If given the opportunity, I look forward to getting to know you too.",
